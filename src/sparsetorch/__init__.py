"""This package implements higher dimensional function approximation by setting up interpolation matrices using different combination methods. Single dimensional basis functions are provided in `sparsetorch.oneD_basis_functions`. These basis functions can be combined into higher dimensional basis functions by using `sparsetorch.dD_basis_functions`.
Model definition and optimization is contained by `sparsetorch.solver`.
`sparsetorch.utils` provides functionality needed during computation, see examples for more details.
`sparsetorch.plotter` enables simple plotting o fresults in 1D and 2D."""
